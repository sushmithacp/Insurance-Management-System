    <h2>Our Top Most Insurances</h2>
      <h4 className="card-title mt-3"><b>Car Insurance</b></h4>
      <p>Once youâ€™ve secured the car of your dreams, the next step is to get car insurance from a reliable provider.
    Think of it as a safety net for your beloved ride and the loved ones who will use it. Car insurance, also called      
    four wheeler insurance, is a contract between an insurer and you, the policyholder to protect you from unpredictable
    circumstances like accidents, theft or natural calamities. In India, car owners have the choice between three types
   of four-wheeler insurance, namely Standalone own-damage insurance, Third-party insurance, and Comprehensive coverage</p>

      <p>If you own a bike, you know its value: the thrill of adventure, fun rides with the family, and the convenience of travelling in the local area. Indian households very quickly become attached to their bikes, and to ensure these sentiments are protected, getting bike insurance is very important. Bike Insurance protects your vehicle from the potential risk of damage and ensures that your bike continues to provide memories even after a setback.</p>

      <p>A health or medical insurance policy covers your medical expenses for illnesses and injuries including hospitalisation, daycare procedures, ambulance charges, medical care at home, medicine costs, and more. It protects the individuals and families from financial burden arising from unexpected medical expenses. Additionally, it helps you save taxes under section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>
